❤️ Heart Attack Risk Predictor — AI Powered

This project is a machine learning–based web application designed to predict the risk of heart attack using clinical health parameters.
It combines data science, AI modeling, and modern web deployment to create a real-world healthcare prediction tool accessible through the browser.

The system uses a trained supervised learning model to analyze medical features such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, heart rate, and more — then provides an instant risk prediction with a simple and user-friendly interface.
